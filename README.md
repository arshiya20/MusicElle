# MusicElle
The main objective of this project is to suggest songs to the user by taking real time pictures. 
The model will take pictures using OpenCV and classify it into different emotions. According to these emotions,
the app will suggest songs.
For instance, our model can suggest songs for happy and sad mood. 
For the future work, the users can have the feature to add songs and make playlist according to their own wish.
